# MDAnalysis Web Site

The new [MDAnalysis web pages](http://www.mdanalysis.org) are currently under construction after
the move from Google Code to GitHub (March 2015). The new home page [www.mdanalysis.org](http://www.mdanalysis.org) is maintained as a [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) site. The home page is also accessible as [mdanalysis.github.io](http://mdanalysis.github.io)).

## Old Google Code site

The old Google Code site is still visible at
<http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com> but see [Issue #223](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues/223) for background.


## Web development

Check out the repository, edit the pages, and push commits. The
published pages are on the *master* branch.  


Right now we are using the minimalist
[Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme for [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) but we can
change this so new pages (apparently) go under `_posts`. The `_site`
directory is generated by Jekyll on the GitHub server side and should
not be included in commits.


### Mark-up format: Markdown

The GitHub pages can either use HTML or
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as processed
by
[Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).


### Local testing

To locally test that your edits look ok before pushing them, install
[Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) as
described in the docs.

To run Jekyll in a way that matches the GitHub Pages build server, run
`Jekyll` with `Bundler`. Use the command 

    bundle exec jekyll serve 

in the root of your repository (after switching to the gh-pages branch
for project repositories), and your site should be available at
<http://localhost:4000>. For a full list of Jekyll commands, see the
Jekyll documentation.
