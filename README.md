# MDAnalysis Web Site

The home page [www.mdanalysis.org](http://www.mdanalysis.org) is maintained as
a [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) site. The home page is also
accessible as [mdanalysis.github.io](http://mdanalysis.github.io).


## Blog [blog.mdanalysis.org](http://blog.mdanalysis.org)

Check out the repository, edit the pages under `_posts`, and push
commits. The published pages are on the *master* branch.

Blog posts should be placed under `_posts`. These should have names
according to:

    YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md

where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, and `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit
numbers. Each post should have a header with:

    ---
    layout: post
    title: The title of this post
    ---

in order for it to be picked up by the paginator. The `blog` directory should
not be touched, as this is only here to set the paginator.

The `_site` directory is generated by Jekyll on the GitHub server side and
should not be included in commits.

You can add a signature to `_config.yml` such as

```yaml
signature:
    yourname:       "[yourname](https://github.com/yourname)"
```
(you don't have to link to your GitHub profile, other profiles are good choices, too, or no link whatsoever) and then sign posts with

    â€” {{site.signature.yourname}}


## Web development

Check out the repository, edit the pages, and push commits. The
published pages are on the *master* branch.  

We are using the minimalist [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme for
[Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/). 

Additional static pages go under `pages`. If they have the layout type "page"
they will be automatically included in the sidebar. We've left the static
"about" page is left at the top level.


### Mark-up format: Markdown

The GitHub pages can either use HTML or
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as processed by
[Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).

### Images

Drop images into the `public/images` directory and include them like

```html
  <img src="{{site.images}}imagename.png"
   style="float: right" alt="alternative text" width="30%"/>
```


### Notes on using Jekyll

For links between pages to work, generate absolute links with `site.baseurl`
liquid tag:

```
[see citations]({{site.baseurl}}pages/citations
```

The example will link to the file `/pages/citations`. Also note that one does
not need spaces between the configuration variable and the curly braces (i.e.
`{{ site.baseurl }}` as typical seen), so I avoid them to prevent the editor
breaking the line inside the curly braces (which upsets Jekyll greatly).

We define additional variables in `_config.yml` and use them with liquid tags.
In particular, the sidebar `_includes/sidebar.html` is configured with
additional links that are all stored in the config file.


### Local testing

To locally test that your edits look ok before pushing them, install
[Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) as
described in the docs.

To run Jekyll in a way that matches the GitHub Pages build server, run `Jekyll`
with `Bundler`. Use the command 

    bundle exec jekyll serve 

in the root of your repository (after switching to the gh-pages branch for
project repositories), and your site should be available at
<http://localhost:4000>. For a full list of Jekyll commands, see the Jekyll
documentation.
