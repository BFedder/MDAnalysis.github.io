# MDAnalysis Web Site

The new [MDAnalysis web pages](http://www.mdanalysis.org) are currently under construction after
the move from Google Code to GitHub (March 2015). The new home page [www.mdanalysis.org](http://www.mdanalysis.org) is maintained as a [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) site. The home page is also accessible as [mdanalysis.github.io](http://mdanalysis.github.io)).

## Old Google Code site

The old Google Code site is still visible at
<http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com> but see [Issue #223](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues/223) for background.


## Web development

Check out the repository, edit the pages, and push commits. The
published pages are on the *master* branch.  


Right now we are using the minimalist
[Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme for [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) but we can
change this so new pages (apparently) go under `_posts`. The `_site`
directory is generated by Jekyll on the GitHub server side and should
not be included in commits.

Additional static pages go under `pages`. If they have the layout type
"page" they will be automatically included in the sidebar. The static
"about" page is left at the top level.

The home page is generated from the only post in the `_posts`
directory. Note that the newest post is on the front page so we don't
really want to use this as a blog site. We should not have much more
need of static pages than what's already there so right now the only
post should be what is to appear as the home page.


### Mark-up format: Markdown

The GitHub pages can either use HTML or
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as processed
by
[Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).

### Notes on using Jekyll

For links between pages to work, generate absolute links with
`site.baseurl` liquid tag:

```
[see citations]({{site.baseurl}}pages/citations
```

The example will link to the file `/pages/citations`. Also note that
one does not need spaces between the configuration variable and the
curly braces (i.e. `{{ site.baseurl }}` as typical seen), so I avoid
them to prevent the editor breaking the line inside the curly braces
(which upsets Jekyll greatly).

We define additional variables in `_config.yml` and use them with
liquid tags. In particular, the sidebar `_includes/sidebar.html` is
configured with additional links that are all stored in the config file.



### Local testing

To locally test that your edits look ok before pushing them, install
[Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) as
described in the docs.

To run Jekyll in a way that matches the GitHub Pages build server, run
`Jekyll` with `Bundler`. Use the command 

    bundle exec jekyll serve 

in the root of your repository (after switching to the gh-pages branch
for project repositories), and your site should be available at
<http://localhost:4000>. For a full list of Jekyll commands, see the
Jekyll documentation.
