# MDAnalysis Web Site

The new MDAnalysis web pages are currently under construction after
the move from Google Code to GitHub.

## Old Google Code site

The old Google Code site is still visible at
<http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com>


## Web development

Check out the repository, edit the pages, and push commits. The
published pages are on the *master* branch.  


Right now we are using the minimalist
[poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) theme for Jekyll but we can
change this so new pages (apparently) go under `_posts`. The `_site`
directory is generated by Jekyll on the GitHub server side and should
not be included in committs.


### Mark-up format: Markdown

The GitHub pages can either use HTML or
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as processed
by
[Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).


### Local testing

To locally test that your edits look ok before pushing them, install
[Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) as
described in the docs.

To run Jekyll in a way that matches the GitHub Pages build server, run
`Jekyll` with `Bundler`. Use the command 

    bundle exec jekyll serve 

in the root of your repository (after switching to the gh-pages branch
for project repositories), and your site should be available at
<http://localhost:4000>. For a full list of Jekyll commands, see the
Jekyll documentation.
