MDAnalysis recently attended [SciPy 2022](https://www.scipy2022.scipy.org/)!

SciPy was a fantastic opportunity to engage with the open-source
community, build connections and see the amazing work being conducted all
across the Scientific Python ecosystem.

Additionally, Hugo MacDermott-Opeskin presented a poster on our ongoing work
as part of our [CZI-EOSS4 grant]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url

[FigShare DOI](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20324931.v1).

As part of the SciPy sprints session we ran an MDAnalysis Sprint
where we invited people to contribute to MDAnalysis and collaborated on
various ideas with community members. We would like to thank members of the
[Zarr](https://zarr.dev/), [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/),
[Dask](https://www.dask.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
and [Pangeo Forge](https://pangeo-forge.org/) communities for some helpful
and stimulating discussions. 


We also participated in a `#bio_at_scipy` meetup to share ideas around engaging
with the broader community and encouraging contributions.
