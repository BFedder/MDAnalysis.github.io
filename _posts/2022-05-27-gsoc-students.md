We are happy to announce that MDAnalysis is hosting two [GSoC][gsoc]
students this year -- @aya9aladdin, and @BFedder. MDAnalysis has been accepted as its own
[organization with GSoC][mda-gsoc] for the third year running and we are grateful to Google for granting us
the opportunity to undertake _two very exciting GSoC projects_!
