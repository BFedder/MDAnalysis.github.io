MDAnalysis is applying for [Google Season of Docs 2019][gsod]. We would
love to have a technical writer work with us to improve our
documentation.

In this program, Google is sponsoring a professional technical writer
to work with an open source project. The open source project gets to
work with a professional in the area of documentation --- something
that almost all projects struggle with and want to improve --- and
the writer gets experience working with an open
source project, e.g., being embedded in the developer community and
using tools such as automatic doc generation and continuous
integration services.

Because MDAnalysis is a project *written by scientists for
scientists*, a writer with MDAnalysis would not only **learn about the
technical aspects** of creating docs for open source code (such as
*documentation generation with Sphinx*, *continuous integration-based
workflows*, *distributed development with git* via our GitHub source code
repository, ...) but also about the science that MDAnalysis
enables. Our developers have published many scientific publications
that used our library or described innovative new methods that were
implemented in MDAnalysis. A writer would interact with these
accomplished scientists and **learn about the science**: *How
molecules (especially biomolecules such as proteins and DNA) are
simulated* and *how scientists analyze such simulations in order to
better understand the world at the microscopic scale*.



# What is MDAnalysis?

MDAnalysis is a **[Python][] library** for the analysis of particle-based
simulations. 

MDAnalysis is also a **community** of hundreds of users and developers. As
a community, we adhere to our [Code of Conduct][].

The **goal of MDAnalysis** is to make it easy for users to analyze data
that are produced by simulations (primarily [molecular dynamics][]
simulations) that run on some of the largest super-computers in the
world. We accomplish this goal by providing an abstract and
object-oriented interface to the simulation data that lends itself to
interactive data exploration and rapid prototyping but is also a
robust foundational library that can form the basis for new
computational tools.

Scientists in our field use [statistical mechanics][] to analyze the
simulation data and make predictions that connect theory and
experiments. For example, the image shows simulated data (points with
error bars) compared to a theoretical model (solid line). The
background shows the protein that was simulated. MDAnalysis was used
for the analysis.




# Project Ideas

Our goal for GSoD is to **make it easy for new users to analyze
_their_ data**. We want to accomplish this goal by

1. providing a quick introduction to the essentials of using
   MDAnalysis through (1) overview documentation and (2) tutorials
   that address common areas of interest of users;   
2. connecting the introductory docs to the API docs so that users can
   easily learn and explore by themselves.  
   

We have listed several [possible projects][ideas] to work on on our
wiki. A summary table is shown below:


| project | name | effort | description |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | User story based documentation | 75% |  Create documentation (starting from existing [MDAnalysis docs](https://www.mdanalysis.org/docs/documentation_pages/overview.html)) addressing common well-known use cases of the library. The structure should be at a higher level than the existing module-level default documentation and similar to the structure used for libraries such as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) and [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html). |
| 2 | Introduction to analyzing Molecular Dynamics trajectories with MDAnalysis | 25% | Create documentation centered around the 2016 SciPy talk by Beckstein ([video](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/learning_MDAnalysis/#introductory), [slides](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/scipy-2016/blob/master/presentation/scipy-MDAnalysis-Beckstein.pdf)) with notebooks illustrating the fundamentals of molecular dynamics and how MDAnalysis facilitates analyzing such simulations. |
| 3 | Quick Start Guide | 25% | Create a guide for getting started with MDAnalysis within a Jupyter notebook in less than 10 minutes. Includes installation, data loading, and sample real-world use case. Base on [MDAnalysis Docs: Overview](https://www.mdanalysis.org/docs/documentation_pages/overview.html#examples) and [MDAnalysis Tutorial](http://www.mdanalysis.org/MDAnalysisTutorial/).  |
| 4 | Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced Tutorials | 50%–100% | Reorganize the existing documentation into Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced material that build upon each other. The tutorials should progress from (beginner) basic trajectory analysis to (intermediate) working with topology information to (advanced) System building (see the [selection of topics](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/Google-Season-of-Docs#improve-and-expand-tutorials)). The material should include code references in GitHub, static or live Jupyter notebooks, and illustrations to facilitate learning and understanding. |

The column **effort** is a rough estimate of what percentage of one
GSoD could be spent on this project. Technical writers can combine a
lower effort project (as an introductory project) with one of the
high-effort projects. Projects with effort ranges are modular in that
we can work on different independent sub-components and thus tailor
the effort.
