Another year, another successful [Google Summer of Code][gsoc]! We had
[two fantastic projects][gsoc-projects] this year, including the first trials of our MDAKit model for building an ecosystem of analysis modules. Both projects were a resounding success and represent an exciting new direction for MDAnalysis.  None of this would have been possible without our wonderful students: [Estefania Barreto-Ojeda][project-estefania], and [Orion Cohen][project-orion]. 

You can read more about their projects and packages in their blog posts:

* Orion: [Solvation Analysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-09-02-gsoc-final-report-orion%})


Finally, a big thank-you to our GSoC mentors: @fiona-naughton, @lilyminium, @orbeckst,
@IAlibay, @richardjgowers and @hmacdope. Their dedication, openness and engagement was
crucial to the success of our students.
