Another year, another successful [Google Summer of Code][gsoc]! We had
[two fantastic projects][gsoc-projects] this year, including the first trials of our MDAKit model for building an ecosystem of analysis modules. Both projects were a resounding success and represent an exciting new direction for MDAnalysis.  None of this would have been possible without our wonderful students: [Estefania Barreto-Ojeda][project-estefania] (@ojeda-e), and [Orion Cohen][project-orion] (@orioncohen). 

You can read more about their projects and packages in their blog posts:
* Estefania: [Curvature for MDA Universes ]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-09-02-gsoc-final-report-estefania%})
* Orion: [Solvation Analysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-09-02-gsoc-final-report-orion%})


We immensely enjoyed working with our GSoC students and look forward to seeing where they take their projects next.
