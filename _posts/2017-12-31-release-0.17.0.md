title: Release 0.17.0
---

Summer is over in the northern hemisphere and with fall coming also comes a new release of MDAnalysis. This release fixes bugs, removes deprecated code, and supports new file formats. The biggest changes however aim at making MDAnalysis sustainable in the long run. The [release note][] lists all the changes in this version.

This release of MDAnalysis comes with a long awaited change: MDAnalysis now **officially support python 3.4 and newer!** We cannot be you excuse to stick to python 2 anymore. Though, python 2.7 remains supported at the moment. The port to python 3 has been a long process that started in 2015 but the final strike was given by [Tyler Reddy][] and [Richard Gowers][] thanks to a [grant awarded by NumFOCUS][grant]. To complete the port, the handling of the DCD format, used by CHARMM and NAMD, had to be completely rewritten, so this release brings a fresh DCD reader and a new low level library to manipulate that file format.

An other change to stay up to date was supported by the [Google Summer of Code][GSoC]. [Utkarsh Bansal][] ported our tests from [nose][] to [pytest][]. Sadly, nose is now deprecated by lack of maintainers. While we liked nose and are thankful to its developers, we had to move away from it. We chose pytest as a replacement as it has a vibrant community and many great features. Utkarsh not only made the tests run under the new framework, he also applied the pytest recommended idioms wherever possible. As a result, our code coverage increased and the tests run significantly faster. While the TravisCI builds used to stop because they needed more than 50 minutes to run, a TravisCI now runs in about 20 minutes.

We did not introduce any new deprecation in this release, but we removed code that we deprecated in previous versions. We are slowly moving toward version 1.0 that will see a long term stabilization of the API. In the mean time, removing deprecated code assures that MDAnalysis remains maintainable.

With this release, you will be able to read TXYZ and ARC files from [Tinker][]. Learn more about these file formats in our documentation. If instead your prefer Amber's netcdf4 trajectories, you should experience a performance gain when reading such trajectories. You should also experience a performance gain of about 20 % when running GNM analyses.

Ten persons contributed to this release, among which two were first time contributors. Thank you to all contributors and welcome to [Nestor Wendt][] and [Micaela Mata][].
