title: Release 0.17.0
---

With the new year comes also a new release of MDAnalysis.
This release fixes bugs, removes deprecated code, and adds support for new file formats. 
The biggest changes however aim at making MDAnalysis more sustainable in the long run. 
The [release note][] lists all the changes in this version.

This release of MDAnalysis comes with a long awaited change: 
MDAnalysis now **officially supports Python 3.4 and newer!** 
We cannot be your excuse to stick with Python 2 anymore. 
Nevertheless, Python 2.7 remains supported for the foreseeable future. 
The port to Python 3 was a long process that started in 2015 and was completed by [Tyler Reddy][] and [Richard Gowers][] thanks to a [grant awarded by NumFOCUS][grant]. 
To complete the port, the handling of the DCD format, used by, e.g., CHARMM and NAMD, had to be completely rewritten, a big task carried out by [Tyler Reddy][] and [Max Linke][] during the last year. 
So this release brings a fresh DCD reader and a new low level library ([libdcd][]) to manipulate DCD files.

An other change to stay up to date was supported by [Google Summer of Code][GSoC]. 
GSoC student [Utkarsh Bansal][] ported our tests from [nose][] to [pytest][]. 
Sadly, nose is now deprecated by lack of maintainers. 
While we liked nose and are grateful to its developers, we had to move away from it. 
We chose pytest as a replacement as it has a vibrant community and many great features. 
Utkarsh not only made the tests run under the new framework but he also applied the pytest recommended idioms wherever possible. 
As a result, our code coverage increased to 91% and the tests run significantly faster. 

We added support for three new trajectory and topology formats. 
The TXYZ and ARC files from [Tinker][] and the GSD format of [HOOMD][].
Learn more about these file formats in our documentation. 
If instead your prefer Amber's netcdf4 trajectories, you should experience a performance gain when reading such trajectories. Gromacs users may notice that the parser for the TPR format now exposes molecule names under the `moltype` attribute of atoms and residues, it also makes it easier to split atom groups by molecules.

We also have various speed improvements in the whole library.
To ensure that MDAnalysis keeps getting faster [Tyler Reddy][] has worked on developing [asv][] benchmarks.
The benchmarks can be found in [Benchmark repo][].

You should also experience a performance gain of about 20 % when running GNM analyses.
For performance we also started experimenting with implementing multi core analysis in [PMDA][].
This release contains fixes to enable the use of PMDA.

Fifteen people contributed to this release, among which five were first time contributors. 
Thank you to all contributors and welcome to [Nestor Wendt][], [Micaela Mata][], [Sören von Bülow][], [Ruggero Cortini][] and [Jose Borreguuero][].
