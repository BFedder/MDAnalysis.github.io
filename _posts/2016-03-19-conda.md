title: Official Conda Builds
---

Starting today MDAnalysis is officially building [conda][conda] packages. The
package are published in the [MDAnalysis organization][mda-channel] on
[anaconda.org][anaconda]. The conda package includes the MDAnalysis packages as
well as the MDAnalysisTests package.

To install MDAnalysis with conda use:

    conda config --add channels MDAnalysis
    conda install mdanalysis

If you later want to update to the next release use:

    conda update mdanalysis

Currently we only support linux 64bit builds for conda. OSX users still have to
use [pip][pip]. We plan to support OSX in the future as well; we'd appreciate
any help here.

The [GridDataFormats][gridData] package is also available through conda on OSX
and linux.
