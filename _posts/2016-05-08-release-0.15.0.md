We have just released MDAnalysis version 0.15.0. This release contains new
features as well as bug fixes. Highlights are listed below but for more details
see the [release notes](https://github.com/MDanalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/...).

We also had a lot of contributions from GSoC applicants. Thanks to our GSoC
students @fiona-naughton and @jdetle as well as the other applicants @Saxenauts,
@Endle, @abhinavgupta94 and @pedrishi.

# Upgrade

You can upgrade with `pip install --upgrade MDAnalysis`

# Noticable Changes

## Deprecations in anticipation of new topology system

The next release (0.16.0) will bring a very big change to the internal workings of MDAnalysis.
The topology system (how atom, residue, segment attributes are stored and manipulated) has been
completely redesigned, giving many advantages and resolving a number of
[longstanding
issues](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/labels/solved%20by%20363).
The new system also brings [speed (up to 40x faster) and memory (up to 60% less
usage) improvements](http://gist.github.com/dotsdl/0e0fbd409e3e102d0458), and
makes the core of MDAnalysis easier to maintain for the future. You can read
more about this at the [original
issue](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues/363), or see [a short
summary of the new
system](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/Issue363-Changes) on the
wiki.

In preparation for this change, we have introduced [deprecation
warnings](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues/599) for all
components of the existing topology system suggesting the corresponding usage
under the new system. Please adjust existing code as you encounter these
warnings.

## Revamped Contact Analysis

Contact Analysis has been completely rewritten in the new *Contacts* class. This
class offers a standard native contact analysis as well as a contact analysis
developed by [Best & Hummer][best-hummer-paper]. A Q1-Q2 analysis is now
available directly as *q1q2*. We have also made the *Contacts* extendable so
that you can pass it your own cut-off functions, the *q1q2* analysis is actually
only a wrapper of *Contacts* that makes use of this flexibility. More
information can be found in the [documentation][contacts-docs].

The old `ContactAnalysis1` and `ContactAnalysis` classes will be removed in the
next release.

## RMSD Calculation

The [*rmsd*][rmsd-docs] function now doesn't super position the given
coordinates by default. The coordinates aren't changed now by default, instead
you can control it with the new *center* and *superposition* keywords.

## PDB Format

Our own PDB parser has seen a lot of love in the last year. It has been the
default for a long time now and all problems that occur for PDB's are fixed only
in this parser. Because of that we have removed the Biopython PDB parser. This
means the `permissive` keyword argument for Universes isn't used anymore.

We also spend time tuning the performance of the PDB trajectory reader. Reading
long PDB trajectories is now significantly faster. Your exact speed up depends
on the length of the trajectory. For 1000 frames we have measured a speed up of
10000%. See PR [#849](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/pull/849) and
Issue [#848](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues/848) for more
details.

Additionally we have added **.ent** files to the list of supported PDB file
formats.
