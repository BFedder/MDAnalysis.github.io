MDAnalysis was **accepted for [Google Season of Docs 2019][gsod]**. We
are proud to be one of 50 [participating open source
organizations][gsod-participants], which span all reaches of open
source and includes the Wikimedia Foundation, NumPy and SciPy, the
CERN High Energy Software Foundation, Drupal, Arduino, LLVM Compiler
Infrastructure, and many more outstanding projects that really have
been moving the open source community forward.

We would love to have a technical writer work with us to improve our
documentation. If you want to **work with scientists that write code to
do science at the molecular scale** then please contact us on the
[developer list][mailing list].


## More about Projects and MDAnalysis

Our recent post on our [GSoD application][gsod-application-post]
explains more of the background and **summarizes our project ideas**.


You can find [detailed project ideas][ideas] on our wiki.

We also have a [Frequently Asked Questions for GSoD with MDAnalysis][FAQ], 
which is being continuously updated.


## Written by scientists for scientists

MDAnalysis is a project *written by scientists for scientists* and is
currently used for cutting edge research around the world.
A writer with MDAnalysis will **learn about the
technical aspects** of creating docs for open source code (such as
*documentation generation with Sphinx*, *continuous integration-based
workflows* and *distributed development with git* via our GitHub
source code repository) and also about the science that MDAnalysis
enables. Our developers have published many scientific publications
that used our library or described innovative new methods that were
implemented in MDAnalysis. A writer will interact with these
accomplished scientists and **learn about the science**: *How
molecules are simulated* (e.g., biomolecules such as proteins and DNA or
novel materials) and *how scientists analyze such simulations in order
to better understand the world at the microscopic scale*.

The video shows the result of a [molecular dynamics simulation][] in which
a sodium ion (magenta sphere) together with water molecules
(red/white "L" shapes) bind to a protein (shown in
[cartoon representation][ribbon representation] as blue and green
ribbons), a process that is important in maintaining the health of
cells in the body. The MDAnalysis package enables us to write code
which can perform calculations on these results,
here allowing us to quantify the interaction
between the ion and the protein and generate fundamental understanding
of important processes in living beings.
