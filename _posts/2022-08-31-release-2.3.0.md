title: MDAnalysis 2.3 is out
---

We are happy to release the version 2.3.0 of MDAnalysis!

This relatively small update to MDAnalysis reflects our commitment
to doing more frequent (trimonthly) releases of the library.

In line with [NEP 29][], the minmum required NumPy version has been
raised to 1.20.0 (1.21.0 for macosx-arm64).

Supported Python versions: **3.8, 3.9, 3.10**

Supported Operating Systems:
  - **Linux** (on [x86_64][], [aarch64][], and [ppc64le][] *note: aarch64 and ppc64le can only be installed via pip for now*)
  - **Windows** (on [x864_64][])
  - **MacOS** (on [x86_64][] and [Apple M1][])


## Upgrading to MDAnalysis version 2.3.0

To update with `conda` from the [conda-forge channel][] run

```bash
conda update -c conda-forge mdanalysis
```

To update from [PyPi][] with `pip` run

```bash
pip install --upgrade MDAnalysis
```

For more help with installation see the [installation instructions in the User Guide][].


## Notable changes

For a full list of changes, bugfixes and deprecations see the [CHANGELOG][].

### Fixes:
 - Fixed reading error when dealing with corrupt PDB CONECT records, and an issue where MDAnalysis would write out unusable CONECT records with index>100000 (Issue #988).

### Enhancements:
 - Formal charges are now read from PDB files and stored in a `formalcharge` attribute (PR #3755).
 - A new normalizing `norm` parameter for the `InterRDF` and `InterRDF_s` analysis methods (Issue #3687).
 - Improved Universe serialization performance (Issue #3721, PR #3710).

### Changes:
 - To install optional packages for different file formats supported by MDAnalysis, use `pip install ./package[extra_formats]` (Issue #3701, PR #3711).

### Deprecations:
 - The `extra_requires` target `AMBER` for `pip install ./package[AMBER]` will be removed in 2.4.0. Use `extra_formats` (Issue #3701, PR #3711).

### CZI EOSS Performance Improvements:

A series of performance improvements to the MDAnalysis library's backend have been made as per planned work under MDAnalysis' CZI EOSS4 grant. Further details about these will be provided in a future blog post.

  - `MDAnalysis.lib.distances` now accepts `AtomGroups` as well as NumPy arrays (PR #3730). 
  - Timestep has been converted to a Cython Extension type (PR #3683).
