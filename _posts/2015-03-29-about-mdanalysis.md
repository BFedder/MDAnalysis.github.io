**MDAnalysis** is an object-oriented python toolkit to analyze
molecular dynamics trajectories generated by
[CHARMM](http://www.charmm.org/), [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org
Gromacs), [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/),
[LAMMPS](http://lammps.sandia.gov/), [Amber](http://ambermd.org/); it
also reads other formats
(e.g. [PDB](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=file_formats/pdb/index.html)
files and [XYZ format](http://openbabel.org/wiki/XYZ_%28format%29)
trajectories; see the **[supported coordinate
formats](https://pythonhosted.org/MDAnalysis/documentation_pages/coordinates/init.html#id1)**
for the full list). It can write most of these formats, too, together
with atom selections for use in [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org),
[CHARMM](http://www.charmm.org/),
[VMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) and
[PyMol](http://www.pymol.org/) (see [selection
exporters](https://pythonhosted.org/MDAnalysis/documentation_pages/selections_modules.html#selection-exporters)
for more details).

MDAnalysis allows one to read molecular dynamics trajectories and
access the atomic coordinates through [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/)
arrays. This provides a flexible and relatively fast framework for
complex analysis tasks. In addition,
[CHARMM-style](http://www.charmm.org/html/documentation/c34b1/select.html)
atom [selection
commands](https://pythonhosted.org/MDAnalysis/documentation_pages/selections.html)
are implemented. Trajectories can also be manipulated (for instance,
fit to a reference structure) and written out.

Please report **bugs** or **enhancement requests** through the [Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues). Questions
can also be asked on the [mdnalysis-discussion mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/mdnalysis-discussion).

## Basic example

A typical usage pattern is to iterate through a trajectory and analyze
coordinates for every frame. In the following example the end-to-end
distance of a protein and the radius of gyration of the backbone atoms
are calculated:

{% highlight python %}
import MDAnalysis
from MDAnalysis.tests.datafiles import PSF,DCD   # test trajectory
import numpy.linalg

u = MDAnalysis.Universe(PSF,DCD)  # always start with a Universe
nterm = u.s4AKE.N[0]  # can access via segid (s4AKE) and atom name
cterm = u.s4AKE.C[-1]             # ... takes the last atom named 'C'
bb = u.selectAtoms('protein and backbone')  # a selection (AtomGroup)

for ts in u.trajectory:     # iterate through all frames
    r = cterm.pos - nterm.pos # end-to-end vector from atom positions
    d = numpy.linalg.norm(r)  # end-to-end distance
    rgyr = bb.radiusOfGyration()  # method of AtomGroup
    print("frame = {0}: d = {1} Å, Rgyr = {2} Å".format(
          ts.frame, d, rgyr))
{% endhighlight %}

# Installation Quick Start

To install the latest stable release, use
[pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html):

{% highlight bash %}
pip install MDAnalysis
{% endhighlight %}

To run the test cases and examples, also install the unit tests (about 20 MiB
in size):

{% highlight bash %}
pip install MDAnalysisTests
{% endhighlight %}

# Learning MDAnalysis

The [MDAnalysis Tutorial](http://orbeckst.github.io/MDAnalysisTutorial/) serves
as an introduction to the library and there are other Tutorials available, too.

See the [Online Documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/MDAnalysis/)
for more information on how to use MDAnalysis and the available
documentation on the Wiki. The [paper on
MDAnalysis](#MichaudAgrawal2011) contains a high-level description of
the structure and philosophy of the library together with examples of
its use.

Finally, you can also ask for advice or help on the
[mdnalysis-discussion mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/mdnalysis-discussion). If you
find *bugs* or want to *request enhancements* please [file a
report](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/ReportingProblems)
in the [Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues).

# Historical, Technical and Artistic Remarks

MDAnalysis was originally inspired by the Schulten Group's
[MDTools](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/MDTools/) for Python, and the DCD
reading code is derived from VMD's
[catdcd](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/MDTools/catdcd/). MDAnalysis is GPL
licensed, except for some 3rd party code that is included under GPL-compatible
licenses; for instance the dcd reading code is under the [UIUC Open Source
Licence](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/MDTools/catdcd/license.html). See
the files AUTHORS and LICENSE in the distribution for details.

Some time-critical routines are written in C or [http://cython.org cython] and
require a working C compiler. The minimum required version of Python is
2.6. MDAnalysis has been successfully used on Linux and Mac OS X.
