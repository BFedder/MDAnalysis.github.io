We are happy to anounce that MDAnalysis is hosting two GSoC students this year.
[Fiona Naughton][fiona-gsoc] and [John Detlefs][john-gsoc].

# Fiona Naughton: Umbrella simulations with MDAnalysis

[Umbrella Sampling][us] is an MD technique which involves performing a series of
simulations in which a *reaction coordinate* , such as the distance between two
molecules, is restrained to different values. A method to analyse the
combination of the simulations is [weighted histogram analysis method][wham]
(WHAM). Fiona will work on adding WHAM to the analysis module to calculate
different observables.

Fiona Naughton is a doing a PhD in Biochemistry at the group from **FOO**. She
already has created a [blog][fiona-blog] and can be found in github under
@fiona-naughton.

# John Detlefs: Dimension Reduction

John is working on adding Dimension reduction algorithms to our analysis module.
He has chosen two algorithms that work purely on the data without additional
input, [principle component analysis][pca] and [diffusion maps][dm].

John Detlefs is a **FOO** major at **BAR**-university. His [blog][john-blog] can
be found at medium and on github he is @jdetle.

In the next weeks they will both further refine their projects and setup
personal blogs to update anyone interested about their progress during the
summer. We plan to have all discussions public on the
[devel mailinglist][devel].
