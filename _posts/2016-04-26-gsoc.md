We are happy to anounce that MDAnalysis is hosting two [GSoC][gsoc] students for
the [PSF][psf] this year, [Fiona Naughton][fiona-gsoc] and
[John Detlefs][john-gsoc].

# Fiona Naughton: Umbrella simulations with MDAnalysis

[Umbrella Sampling][us] is an MD technique which involves performing a series of
simulations in which a *reaction coordinate* , such as the distance between two
molecules, is restrained to different values. A method to analyse the
combination of the simulations is [weighted histogram analysis method][wham]
(WHAM). Fiona will work on adding WHAM to the analysis module to calculate
different observables.

Fiona Naughton is doing a PhD in Biochemistry at the University of Oxford with
the Structural Bioinformatics and Computational Biochemistry Unit, studying
protein/membrane interactions through molecular dynamics simulations. She has
started her own [blog][fiona-blog] and can be found on github under
@fiona-naughton. She plans to continue to a career in the same field and outside
academia enjoys reading, baking and handicraft.

# John Detlefs: Dimensionality Reduction

MD-simulations produce data with several thousand dimensions, from which we want
to learn something new about how proteins work and how they interact with each
other. Fortunaly for us in a lot of cases one or two dimensions are enough to
describe a specific function of a protein. Dimensionionality reduction
algorithms help us to find projections into low dimensional subspaces that
capture the relevant motions. John has chosen to implement
[principal component analysis][pca] and [diffusion maps][dm].

John Detlefs is a Mathematics and Chemistry double major at California
Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. His blog can be found on
[his website][john-blog] and on github he is @jdetle. When not contributing to
MDAnalysis, John can be found reading a good book or enjoying one of the many
outdoor activities California has to offer. After graduating in June 2016, John
plans on pursuing a career in scientific computing.

In the next weeks they will both further refine their projects and setup
personal blogs to update anyone interested about their progress during the
summer. We plan to have all discussions public on the
[devel mailinglist][devel].
