We have just released MDAnalysis version 0.13.0.

# Upgrade

You can upgrade with `pip install --upgrade MDAnalysis`

# Noticable Changes

## Usage of openMP

The `MDAnalysis.lib.parallel.distances` module has been merged into
`MDAnalysis.lib.distances`. To select the openMP implementation all functions in
that module now accept a `backend='openMP'` keyword. See
[#530](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues/530).

## Performance Enhancements for GRO-files

Reading GRO files has been sped up for large files. Velocities will now also be
written written for GRO files if possible.

## Others

This release contains other performance enhancements and fixes. For a detailed
list see the
