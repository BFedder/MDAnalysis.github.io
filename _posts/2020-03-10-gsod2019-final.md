style="float: right" alt="GSoD with MDAnalysis" width="40%"/> The
inaugural [Google Season of Docs][gsod] 2019 has wrapped up. Google
sponsored a technical writer to work with an open source project to
work on their documentation. MDAnalysis was [one of the GSoD
projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-05-01-gsod2019 %}) with
technical writer @lilyminium.

She [successfully completed her project][gsod-participants] *A user
guide structured by topic*. She shared her thoughts in her blog post
[Project report: A user guide for MDAnalysis][project-report].

## Quick Start Guide

Especially for **new users**, @lilyminium created the new **[Quick Start
Guide][]**, which is now the recommended first tutorial when learning
MDAnalysis.

## User Guide


The new **[User Guide][]** is meant to make it easy for **all users** to
quickly become productive with MDAnalysis. 

It starts with a **Getting Started** section with installation
instructions, examples, the Quick Start Guide, and a FAQ. A discussion
of the **key data structures** follows because understanding how to
work with `Universe` and `AtomGroup` is fundamental to MDAnalysis. A
section on **selections** explains how to create `AtomGroup`s. The
next chapters explain working with **trajectories** (including the new
[on-the-fly transformations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url
2020-03-09-on-the-fly-transformations %})) and general
**input/output**. Most **analysis** classes are described and
explained with examples, making the analysis section especially useful
for anyone who "quickly wants to run analysis X" on their own
trajectories.

The User Guide also documents a number of important internals and
usage patterns as well as the devlopment process, which makes it a key
reference for intermediate users and developers.

As one seasoned core developer said: *"Amazing, reading this I can
still learn new things about MDAnalysis!"*

You can already see the pre-1.0 version of the new **[User Guide][]** on
our website; an expanded version of the User Guide will be released
together with the [upcoming 1.0 release of MDAnalysis]({{ site.baseurl
}}{% post_url 2019-11-06-roadmap %}).


## More to come...

Furthermore, the new [MDAnalysis docs][docs] will follow the
layout and style of the User Guide.

Finally, @lilyminium will continue working with MDAnalysis as
our newest [MDAnalysis Core Developer][coredevs]!
