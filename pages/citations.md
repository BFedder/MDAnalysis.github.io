MDAnalysis and the included algorithms are scientific software that
are described in academic publications. **Please cite these papers when you use
MDAnalysis in published work.**

It is possible to [automatically generate a list of
references]({{site.pypi.docs}}/documentation_pages/references.html#citations-using-duecredit)
for any program that uses MDAnalysis. This list (in common reference
manager formats) contains the citations associated with the specific
algorithms and libraries that were used in the program.



## MDAnalysis library ##

When using MDAnalysis in published work, please cite the following two
papers. 

(We are asking you to cite *both* papers if at all possible because
the 2016 paper describes many updates to the original 2011 paper and
neither paper on its own provides a comprehensive description of the
library. We will publish a complete self-contained paper with the
upcoming 1.0 release of MDAnalysis, which will then supersede these
two citations.)
