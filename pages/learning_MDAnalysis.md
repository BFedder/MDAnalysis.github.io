title: Learning MDAnalysis
---

Once you had a look at the 
[basic example]({{site.baseurl}}pages/basic_example) 
you might want to learn more about how to use
MDAnalysis. MDAnalysis is primarily a library that helps you to build
your own tools but it also works very well for **interactive data
exploration** of MD data in [IPython](http://ipython.org/), in
particular within [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and in
conjunction with [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/). MDAnalysis is
well suited for a *rapid development* approach.

The resources below should help you to quickly find out to best use
MDAnalysis for your own specific uses.


## Tutorials ##

The [MDAnalysis
Tutorial](http://www.mdanalysis.org/MDAnalysisTutorial/) serves as an
introduction to the library and there are [other
tutorials]({{site.github.wiki}}/Tutorials)
available, too.


## Documentation ##

See the [Online Documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/MDAnalysis/)
for more information on how to use MDAnalysis and the available
documentation on the Wiki. The [paper on
MDAnalysis]({{site.baseurl}}pages/citations#MichaudAgrawal2011) contains a
high-level description of the structure and philosophy of the library
together with examples of its use.


## Mailing list ##

Finally, you can also ask for advice or help on the
[mdnalysis-discussion mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/mdnalysis-discussion). If you
find *bugs* or want to *request enhancements* please [file a
report]({{site.github.wiki}}/ReportingProblems)
in the [Issue
Tracker]({{sitemap.github.issues}}).
